#BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION AND ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING

This project focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. By analyzing medical data, including mammograms, histopathological images, and patient demographics, these algorithms can identify patterns and classify tumors as benign or malignant with high accuracy. This approach not only enhances early detection but also aids in personalized treatment plans, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The integration of machine learning in breast cancer research represents a significant step towards more efficient and effective healthcare solutions.
